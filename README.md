# Real Estate Website
As a freelance software engineer, I have developed a real estate website for a client who is a realtor. The website showcases properties and provides a seamless user experience for potential buyers. Leveraging the Zillow API, users can explore property listings, view detailed information, and make inquiries directly through the website. With a focus on responsiveness, the website ensures optimal display across devices, enabling users to conveniently browse and inquire about homes.

## Technologies Used

The project utilizes the following technologies:

- **Front-end:**
  - React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - HTML5 & CSS3: Markup and styling languages for web development.
  - Bootstrap: CSS framework for responsive and modern designs.

## Key Features

- Property Listings: Displaying properties with details, including images, descriptions, location, and pricing.
- Contact and Inquiry Forms: Enabling users to contact the realtor and make inquiries about properties.
- Responsive Design: Ensuring the website is fully responsive and optimized for various devices and screen sizes.
