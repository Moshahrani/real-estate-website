The project utilizes the following technologies:

- **Front-end:**
  - React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - HTML5 & CSS3: Markup and styling languages for web development.
  - Bootstrap: CSS framework for responsive and modern designs.

## Key Features

- Property Listings: Displaying properties with details, including images, descriptions, location, and pricing.

- Responsive Design: Ensuring the website is fully responsive and optimized for various devices and screen sizes.
